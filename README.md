## GitHub Finder
GitHub Finder is a simple React application that allows you to search for GitHub profiles and view user information and repositories. The application uses the GitHub API to fetch user data and repositories.

### Live Demo
You can see the live demo of the application [here](https://github-finder-evan.netlify.app/).

### Features
- Search for GitHub users by username.
- View user profile information including avatar, number of repositories, followers, and following.
- List user repositories with descriptions and last updated dates.
- Smooth transitions between pages using Framer Motion.
- Error handling for non-existent GitHub users.

### Note on Commit History
Please note that the commit history for this project is limited. This is because I had to create a new git project to ensure the GitHub token used for API requests is kept hidden and secure.
